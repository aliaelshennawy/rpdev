        .col-sm-6
          p Since our formation, our focus has been creating partnerships with those we work for. Our success relies on their success. We take this commitment to our clients extremely seriously, and because of that have developed lasting relationships.The pinnacle of our success is earning our client's trust.High Trust = Low Cost and High Speed while Low Trust = High Cost and Low Speed.Foundational to our success is our estimating department. The majority of the projects we construct are projects that we have been intimately involved with since our client acquired the land. We assist the owner in preliminary budgets used for acquisition, value-engineer the project through design, and assemble the final project budget. Because of this system, our clients know what the true cost is months or even years before the first yard of dirt is moved the transition from the estimate to the field is one that we take seriously. Knowing the client's desires, schedule constraints, budget, and milestone needs allows us to work backwards to ensure the project is adequately staffed. Our team in the field is budget-minded, schedule-driven, and perfection-oriented.Delivering results consistently is not something that happens by accident or without effort, but it is something that happens every time
